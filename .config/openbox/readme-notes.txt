For the Directories submenu to work in menu.xml, place dir-menu.py in /usr/local/menu. (You can just create the 'menu' folder in /usr/local if it's not already there)

Also, for the text icons in my menu.xml to work, you'll have to get the Arimo Nerd Font and set it as your menu font in obconf. Other Nerd Fonts *may* work, but I haven't tried to find out.
